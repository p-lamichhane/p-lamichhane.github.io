      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am a Civil Engineer specializing in traffic engineering, construction cost estimation, and infrastructure design. My research focuses on traffic intersection performance evaluation and optimization using microsimulation techniques.

        My undergraduate research project involved performance evaluation of signalized intersections and developing enhancement measures. I led a team of 5 to conduct traffic volume data analysis and developed calibrated traffic flow simulations using SIDRA Intersection, optimizing traffic signal timing and lane configurations. This work achieved a ~20% decrease in intersection delay with lane reconfiguration and optimized signal timing.

        I have also worked on highway expansion projects, performing traffic performance analysis using Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) such as delay, Level of Service (LOS), and queue length, analyzing future demand scenarios over 10 and 20 years.

        Please reach out to collaborate on traffic engineering and infrastructure projects 😃
