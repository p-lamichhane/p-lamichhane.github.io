abstract: This study presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of the Durbarmarg intersection in Kathmandu District, focusing on traffic flow optimization and enhancement measures. The research involved leading a team of 5 to conduct traffic volume data analysis of a signalized intersection. Calibrated traffic flow simulations were developed using SIDRA Intersection, optimizing traffic signal timing and lane configurations to improve roadway performance using Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) such as delay, Level of Service (LOS), and queue length. The study achieved approximately 20% decrease in intersection delay with lane reconfiguration and optimized signal timing under restrained width conditions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Performance evaluation and optimization of Durbarmarg intersection using SIDRA Intersection simulation, achieving ~20% reduction in intersection delay through lane reconfiguration and signal timing optimization.
