    summary: |
      Performed traffic performance analysis using Measure of Effectiveness (MOE) such as delay, LOS and queue length for an intersection on a highway expansion project. Analyzed future demand scenarios over 10 and 20 years using microsimulation techniques on SIDRA Intersection. Achieved an 87% reduction in delay and a 94% reduction in queue length of the calibrated model. Further reduced delay by 83% and queue length by 94% after implementing an underpass.
